A collection of simple Lua and Rust games, and a web engine for playing them including an English dictionary (for word puzzles), websocket multiplayer, state sharing via URL, and auto saving with undo/redo. You can also upload your own games and play them.

* Checkers/Draughts
* "Endless Runner": Tap the screen or press space bar to propel yourself upwards, dodging the endless oncoming obstacles.
* Minesweeper
* Fluid Mix: Rearrange the stacks where you can only move stacks onto empty stacks or stacks of the same colour, until each stack has only a single colour.
* Backgammon
* Cribbage
* "Spider Swing": swing from point to point, being careful not to lose too much height or speed.
* "Thrust": Race your space ship around the track, trying to control your momentum.
* Gomoku/Wuziqi/Omok: Place stones on a Go board, trying to be the first to create a line of 5.

The android app bundles the web version for offline play. (For network multiplayer, try the web version at https://alexbarry.github.io/AlexGames).

On the Android version there are two prototype features:
* you can host an HTTP/websocket server on your phone, to allow people on your local network to play web games together.
* you can play the Android native version. The web version is more polished, but the Android one demonstrates how games can be played without using a browser or webview at all.
